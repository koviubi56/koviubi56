[![Pylance gave me an error](/assets/pyenv-pylance.png)](#pylance)

Or

[Something else](#else)

### Pylance

First, make sure you installed the package. After installing it, reload VS Code (`workbench.action.reloadWindow`).
If you did everything right, the message should have disappeared. If it did not, follow the instructions [below](#else).

### Else

The most common error, is that the package is installed, _in the wrong environment_.

What operating system do you use? _(please click)_

[Windows](#os-windows) or [Something else](#os-else)

#### OS Windows

Open up the terminal _([Need more help?](#win-terminal))_.

---

### Win terminal

We assume you have Windows 7 or above. Click on the Windows icon in the left corner. In the start menu, search for `cmd.exe`.
Run it. Yayy, you opened the terminal!
