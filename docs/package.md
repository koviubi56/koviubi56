## pip and installing packages

_After you‚Äôre done, **please** give us some [feedback](#feedback). It would **really** help us make this website better for everyone._

Did you get a `ModuleNotFoundError`? _(please click)_

## No

Great. First, make sure python is installed, with this command: `py --version` if you're on Windows, `python3 --version` otherwise (run the command in a shell/terminal/consol).

What do you see? _(please click)_

[![I see "Pyton X.Y.Z"](/assets/package-pyver.png)](#pyver),

[![I see "Command not found"](/assets/package-notfound1.png)](#notfound), or

[`"NameError: name 'python' is not defined"`](#nameerror)

---

### NameError

You got this, beacuse this command and other suggested commands in this tutorial are intended to be run in a _shell_ (also called a terminal or console). See the Python for Beginners [getting started tutorial](https://opentechschool.github.io/python-beginners/en/getting_started.html#what-is-python-exactly) for an introduction to using your operating system's shell and interacting with Python.

If you're done, [start again](#no).

---

### NotFound

If you're on Windows, make sure that you wrote `py --version`. If you're _**not**_ on Windows, make sure that you wrote `python3 --version`.

If you _still_ get an error, try to install python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/) or refer to the [Installing Python](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/installation/#installation) section of the Hitchhiker's Guide to Python.

If you're done, [start again](#no).

---

### Pyver

Super! Now check if you have pip installed. If you're on Windows, run `py -m pip --version`, otherwise run `python3 -m pip --version`.

Did you get something like `pip X.Y.Z from path/to/pip (python x.y)`? _(please click)_

<a href="#gotpip"><img src="/koviubi56/assets/yes.png" alt="Yes, I did!" style="width: 5em;"></a>
<a href="#no-pip"><img src="/koviubi56/assets/no.png" alt="No, I did not!" style="width: 5em;"></a>

---

### No pip

On Windows run: `py -m ensurepip --default-pip` Everywhere else run: `python3 -m ensurepip --default-pip`

Did you get an error? _(please click)_

<a href="#no-pip-error"><img src="/koviubi56/assets/yes.png" alt="Yes, I did!" style="width: 5em;"></a>
<a href="#pyver"><img src="/koviubi56/assets/no.png" alt="No, I did not!" style="width: 5em;"></a>

### No pip error

**If** you got an error, download [`get-pip.py`](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py), and run it. [Warning!](#getpip-warning)

### No pip error feedback

If you got an error while running `get-pip.py`, click [here](#feedback), and we'll try to make this guide better.

### Gotpip

Great! Now make sure that pip, setuptools, and wheel is up-to-date. On Windows run: `py -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel` Everywhere else run: `python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel`

It is _optional_, but you can use a [virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/#optionally-create-a-virtual-environment), but it is **optional**, not required.

Now you just need to install the package. Click [here](#final) for the final step.

### getpip warning

**Warning**: Be cautious if you‚Äôre using a Python install that‚Äôs managed by your operating system or another package manager. get-pip.py does not coordinate with those tools, and may leave your system in an inconsistent state. You can use `python get-pip.py --prefix=/usr/local/` to install in `/usr/local` which is designed for locally-installed software.

**Warning**: Make sure to download `get-pip.py` **securely**. So with a modern webbrowser, or with curl. The SSL certificates should be verified.

**Warning**: Using `get-pip.py` may require root or administrator privileges.
