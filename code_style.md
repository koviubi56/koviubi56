# Python Style Guidelines

## Abstract

Since we make free and open-source software (FOSS), we accept contributions from people across the world. Everyone has their way of writing code. But the code should be consistent.

## Specification

### Requirements

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

The guidelines stated here should only be used if it is reasonable, and it isn't required/noted otherwise.

### The Guidelines

- The code MUST follow PEP 8. Some additional stuff to PEP 8:
  - If you cannot break a line, try to use a backslash (`\`)
  - Line breaks (as stated in PEP 8) should be BEFORE any operators
  - All text files SHALL be encoded in UTF-8. Source code files SHOULD only consist of the printible ASCII character (from 30 (0x20) to 126 (0x7E) inclusive).
  - Except for one-line ones, docstring MUST have a new line after the opening, and before the closing([example](https://github.com/sco1/flake8-annotations/blob/7e44ba73866e92fcce8d1c9ca082ffaabec99d9c/flake8_annotations/checker.py#L53-L58)). (This is permitted by [PEP 257](https://archive.ph/kY0Hw#selection-615.313-615.399).)
  - As described in PEP 257, double-quotes MUST be used for docstrings.

- Double-quotes MUST be used. If double-quotes are already in the string (except docstrings and triple quote strings), single-quotes SHOULD be used; escaping (`\"`) MAY be used.

- Semi-colons (in code) MUST NOT be used (unless for timeit codes).

- The walrus operator (`:=`) MAY be used.

- Logging SHOULD be done with [mylog](https://github.com/koviubi56/mylog).

- A star (`*`, keyword only), and a slash (`/`, positional only) MAY be used in arguments.

- Exception SHOULD NOT directly inherit directly from "BaseException".

- There SHOULD be backwards and forward compatibility.

- Properties SHOULD NOT have setters. Try changing them to an instance variable, or make a `set_*` method for it.

- Comprehensions MAY be used, but only if they are easy to read and understand.

- "Hiding" important function calls within if and other statements is NOT RECOMMENDED:

```python
if run_important_thing() == 0:
    ...
```

- `is` and `is not` MUST be used for [real constants](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#built-in-constants), classes, and singletons, and they MUST NOT be used for literals (str, int, float, ...).

- Instead of doing this: `MISSING = object()`, it SHOULD be like this:

```python
class _Missing:
    pass  # the class MAY be a dataclass or MAY have a __repr__

Missing = _Missing()
```

- "Just container" classes SHOULD use dataclasses.

- Properties MUST be kept short, they MUST NOT do expensive calculations.

- Threads SHOULD only be used sparingly, and/or only if the user knows about them. There MUST NOT be a lot of threads. Threads SHOULD be daemon.

- For paths `pathlib.Path` and its methods SHOULD be used.

- If possible always use binary reads and writes (this means pass binary instead of string to `json.load`, but feel free to use regular reads and writes when it is reasonable). If binary cannot be used, UTF-8 SHOULD be used. The encoding argument MUST be explicitly passed as a keyword argument (`encoding=`), and it MUST be written as `"utf-8"` (all lowercase).

- f-strings SHOULD be used instead of `"{}".format()`, `"" + x + ""`, and `"%s" % str`. Percent formatting `"%s"` MUST NOT be used. In f-strings `{x!r}` (and others) SHOULD be used instead of `{repr(x)}`.

- Too broad `except`s SHOULD NOT be used, unless reasonable (because there are situations where you _do_ need it).

- The code SHOULD have comments. Older codes that don't have enough/good comments SHOULD be updated, but

> Comments that contradict the code are worse than no comments.

[PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#comments)

#### Variable names

- Per PEP 8, names (variables, functions, files, ...) MUST use snake_case; class names MUST use CapWords.

#### Docstrings

- The [Google docstring style](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/example_google.html) MUST be used, BUT:
  - There MUST be a new line after the opening triple-quotes.
  - Module/Package/Class level docstrings MAY have a "Attributes" section
  - Docstrings SHOULD NOT have a Todo(s) section.
  - reStructuredText or anything like that MUST NOT be used (instead use markdown).
  - Examples (doctests) MUST be put after the main description, and before the arguments (but the use of docstrings is OPTIONAL).
  - Argument types in docstrings MUST reflect the type hints (so `:obj:int` and `list(str)` MUST NOT be used, `list[str]` MUST be used instead).
  - Argument types in docstrings MUST have `, optional` before the `)` if they are optional, and they MUST have `Defaults to x.` at the end.
  - Properties' and special/magic method's docstrings MUST be the same as if they were a normal regular function.
  - `self` MUST NOT be included in `Args`.
- Every function SHOULD have a docstring, and they MAY have a doctest. Any function that starts with an underscore (e.g. `_private`, `__really_private`, `__magic__`) MAY have a docstring.

#### Type hinting

- Type hints MUST be used for function arguments, function return values, and other places where reasonable.
- Type hints MAY be used with local and/or private variables.
- The generics MUST be provided when using generic types (`list[str]`, `dict[str, int]`, ...).
- `typing` generics (`typing.List`) SHOULD NOT be used. Instead, the normal ones (`list`) SHOULD be used.
- The `if TYPE_CHECKING: import` style([example](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/blob/5dd9b4f5ca5715ed2bd65378201473b45c419c89/pydantic/main.py#L74-L91)) MUST NOT be used. Additionally only type hinting something when `TYPE_CHECKING` is True([example](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/blob/5dd9b4f5ca5715ed2bd65378201473b45c419c89/pydantic/main.py#L312-L327)) MUST NOT be used either.
- If possible, most of the type hinting stuff imported from `typing` SHOULD be moved to `typing_extensions` for compatibility, _unless_ the object being imported is already in `typing` on the oldest supported python version.
- `collections.abc` SHOULD be used instead of `typing` for objects that are in both.
